DRILL: Am I Biased?

For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. There is plenty of room for interpretation here, so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.

1.  You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
- You will get more interest in bathing suit purchases in May rather than February.
- February is at the end of the winter month and people are less likely to purchase a bathing suit then
- May is the  last month of spring and summer is around the corner
- May is also when school is getting ready to let out for summer vacation
- People travel to destinations that require bathing suits more so in the warmer months

2.  You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
- Your test group is already biased. Of course the people who visit the clinic will show a higher rate of anxiety than the general public.  The people coming to the clinic are saying that they have anxiety and are seeking treatment.  They would be answering questionaires and speaking with the care providers in regards to their anxiety
- General public might not be as willing to give truthful answers - if they are being asked the correct question
- General public might not be comfortable in disclosing information in regards to their anxiety

3.  You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
- People are more likely to visit the website in the beginning due to curiousity
- Is there any other advertising plays being made or are we just reliant on the billboard
- Once people come to the website, they might have their questions answered and do not visit after that
- Perhaps the billboard advertising is effective in creating initial interest, but is there anything to continue advertising or visibility?

4.  You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
- Not enough time to gauge actual change
- When in the season is the loyalty program being launched?
- Has advertisting happened to create visibility?
- Who is the target group?
